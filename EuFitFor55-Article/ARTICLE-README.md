This is an analysis that backed my Article titled "From "Fit to 55" to Fit for Everyone" included in the Ecosprinter 2024 Annual edition.  
The question my contribution tries to tackle is how much the "average european citizen" should decrease its carbon footprint to stick to "Fit for 55"'s direction.
In details, it compares the single individual's average carbon fooprint in the period 1990-2022 to the ideal carbon footpring they should have from 2022-2030 achieve the 55% emissions reduction.
Results are interesting, and give us hope that every single contribution counts.  
Both Python (especially Jupiter Notebook) and Tableau have been used. All data comes from the Eurostat and the EEA.  

In this repository can be found (except for this ReadMe):  

1Ô∏è‚É£. a .ipynb file that is the analysis' code.  
2Ô∏è‚É£. a .pdf file that is the final article has it has been published.  
3Ô∏è‚É£. an in_data folder that contains data sources  
4Ô∏è‚É£. an out_data folder which contains dataframes coming from the analysis  
5Ô∏è‚É£. an img folder that includes article's images
