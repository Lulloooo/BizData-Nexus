# ⏯️ Tik-Tok Reports & Claims Analysis

This project analyzes Tik-Tok users' reports and claims.   
⚽️ The main goal is to develop a model to better distinguish between opinions (what a user thinks) and claims (unsourced fact),
in order to prioritize them more effectively.  
  
To achieve this, several machine learning techniques were used, including Decision Trees, Random Forests and XGBoosting.
Python (especially Jupyter Notebook), Google Colab, and Word were used throughout the analysis.  
  
In this repo, you will find the following:

**2️⃣. Models folder**: Contains serialized versions of trained models.  
**3️⃣. InitialConsiderations-and-planning.pdf**: A stakeholder-ready planning documents. It includes data's strenght and pitfall plus the analysis description.  
**4️⃣. models folder**: Contains serialized versions of trained models.  
**5️⃣. out_data Folder**: Includes datasets resulting from the analysis.    
**6️⃣. img folder**: Stores plots and images saved from the analysis.
