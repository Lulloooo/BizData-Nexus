Welcome to my Business and Data Analysis projects hub 📊  
Think of this repo as **my personal-and-professional website**, aka Lullo.com. 🌐 Here, you’ll find most of the Business & Data Analysis projects I’ve worked on over the years as a Business Data Analyst 📈. Whether for professional purposes or just for fun, if I’ve touched it, you'll find it here. 🔢
