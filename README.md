# BizData-Nexus aka _LulloBizDataAnalysis.com_
Welcome to my Business and Data Analysis projects hub 📊  
Think of this repo as **my personal-and-professional website**, aka Lullo.com. 🌐 Here, you’ll find most of the Business & Data Analysis projects I’ve worked on over the years as a Business Data Analyst 📈. Whether for professional purposes or just for fun, if I’ve touched it, you'll find it here. 🔢

To keep things tidy, **every project has its own folder 📁**.   
Each folder name gives a hint of what the analysis is about. If it seems a bit brief, don’t worry — each analysis comes with a README to walk you through the project. That, of course, isn't the only thing inside the folder. You'll find also:

- 1️⃣ **README.md**: an analyisis' detailed description, highlitinhg its main goals.
- 2️⃣ **Code**: The scripts and code files used for that specific projects.
- 3️⃣ **Final Report**: A summary of key insights, results and data-driven recommendations from the analysis.
- 4️⃣ **in_data Folder**: Where the raw data sources are stored.
- 5️⃣ **out_data Folder**: For the data, tables, and dataframes that resulted from the analysis.
- 5️⃣ **img Folder**: All the charts and images created during the analysis.
- 6️⃣ **Other Files/Folders**: Anything else that might be useful, like documentation, relevant papers, or additional resources

Feel free to dig into 🔎 any folder that piques your interests. I'm always open to new perspectives about my work and firmly believe that there is always something new to learn.
