# Aus-MacroEcoAnalysis
This project is an additional part of the project within the labor demand repository. Altogether, these 2 projects were part of  an University project (passed with Honors 🎉) and the first time I employed R for my analysis. 
This specific case study aims to analyze macro-variables for Austria and estimate the Philips-curve for it. More in details, I employed time series analysis, differencing, stationarity tests and different OLS models (along with the BIC for lag selection and robust standard errors) to estimate the Philips curve. 
❗️Detailed analysis' results and discussion can be found in the Austria-MacroEco-Analysis.pdf file.
This project contains 2 files and 2 folder (ReadMe.md excluded):

1️⃣ a .pdf file that contains the analysis and the estimation procedure and results  
2️⃣ a .R file that contains the code of the estimation  
3️⃣ in_data folder that contains the df that has been analyzed.  
4️⃣ out_data folder that contains the output (plots) from the .R file.
