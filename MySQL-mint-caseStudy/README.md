# Analyze data in a model car database with MySQL workbench
Coursera project in which I stepped into the shoes of an entry level data analyst at the fictional company called "Mint Classic". The task is to analyze data in a relational database with the goal of driving inventory related business decision. The main tool used are: SQL (especially MySQL); standard SQL commands used for retrieving and analyzing data and merging tables; and basic-business related knowledge.
The repository contains 3 different files (README.md excluded)

1Ô∏è‚É£ A MySQL file that contains the SQL code for the analysis  
2Ô∏è‚É£ A .rtf file that is a detailed step-by-step commentary of the MySQL file's commands in order to make the step of the analysis easy to understand and reproduce. **Note**: As it is a good practice, short comments are already included in MySQL file. The supplementary .rtf file is a complete step-by-step guide with a description of every single comments.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ A .pdf (Approach&Insights) file that contains the description of the approach and the data-driven reccomendations/insights for the company in order to reach its goal.  

**NOTE**: all data is fictional.
Feel free to get in touch with me for every comments/feedbacks that you may have. It would be appreciated. üì©
