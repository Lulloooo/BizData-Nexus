# üìà DECODING FINANCIAL TRENDS: AN ANALYSIS OF WORLD BANK FINANCIAL INDICATORS

This is an analysis examining major financial indicators for 7 different countries. 
The main goal is to obtain a general overview of public markets in different States. Moreover, at the end an ARIMA model is settled up to estimate future values of SP500 Index in the US.  
Results are fascinating, showing that there is not a single country that financially overwhelmes the others and remarking the necessity to always consider indicators altogether.  
Python (especially Jupiter Notebook) has been used. All data comes from the World Bank and were retrieved through an API.
 
In this repository it can be found (except for this ReadMe):  

1Ô∏è‚É£. a .ipynb file that is the analysis' code and final report.  
2Ô∏è‚É£. a .pdf file that is the same as the ipynb file but in a different format.  
4Ô∏è‚É£. an out_data folder containing dataframes coming from the analysis  
5Ô∏è‚É£. an img folder that includes images
