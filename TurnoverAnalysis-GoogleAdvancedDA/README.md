# üöò Salifort Motors Employees Turnover Analysis - Google Advanced Data Analysis Project  

This project analyzes employee turnover at the fictional company Salifort Motors. The main goals were twofold:  
  
- Develop a model to predict whether an employee is likely to leave (i.e., resign or be fired).
- Understand the main drivers behind employee attrition.
  
To achieve this, several machine learning techniques were used, including Random Forests, XGBoost, Stacking Ensemble, SVM, and Neural Networks. The dataset comes from this public Kaggle repository: [Hr Analytics Job Prediction üîó.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mfaisalqureshi/hr-analytics-and-job-prediction?select=HR_comma_sep.csv)  
Python (especially Jupyter Notebook), Google Colab, and PowerPoint were used throughout the analysis.  
  
In this repo, you will find the following:   
  
**1Ô∏è‚É£. SalifortAnalysis.ipynb**: The full analysis code, including comments, final insights, actionable recommendations, and suggestions for future improvements.  
**2Ô∏è‚É£. ModelDeployment.ipynb**: An early-stage deployment notebook. Input employee features and get a predicted probability of resignation.  
**3Ô∏è‚É£. Salifort_ExecutiveSummary.pdf**: A stakeholder-ready executive summary. It presents results, insights, and recommendations in a concise format.  
**4Ô∏è‚É£. DataDictionrary.xlsx**: The data dictionary for the dataset, with details on each variable. 
**5Ô∏è‚É£. models folder**: Contains serialized versions of trained models.  
**6Ô∏è‚É£. out_data Folder**: Includes datasets resulting from the analysis.    
**7Ô∏è‚É£. img folder**: Stores plots and images saved from the analysis.   
**7Ô∏è‚É£. in_data folder**: Contains the input datasets used for the analysis. If empty, the dataset was sourced directly online.
