# 🏦 JPM Quantitative researcher - job simulator

This repo contains the analyses I did during a job simulation as a Quantitative researcher At JP Morgan.👨‍💻 The simulation focuses on quantitative research methods.🔢   
Through the various tasks, I employed different Machine-learning techniques to predict different financial and risk-related indicators.
In the last task, dynamic programming has been used too. Plus, I tackled all the tasks in the python and jupiter environment.  

The structure of this repo 🗂️ is pretty straightforward. The main repo is divided into folders named after the task they perform.
Each sub-folders includes the data source along with the code script and an example of how the could be performed (the _ex or _example files). The .pdf file is the certification.

In a nutshell, the tasks 📋 were:  
  
1️⃣ **Task 1**: The aim is to estimate the purchase price of gas at any date in the past and extrapolate it for one year into the future. ARIMA, SARIMA and Prophet have all been tested here.  
2️⃣ **Task 2**: The objective is to build a pricing model able to price different type of natural-gas-storage contracts. This was a task relying heavely on programming, 
and no statistical model was built. Just a code able to take inputs, fit them in the computed function, and return outputs.  
3️⃣ **Task 3**: The request is to analyze a book of loans to estimate a customer's probability of default. ML models are used here.   
4️⃣ **Task 4**: The goal is to convert FICO scores into categorical data to predict defaults. Dynamic programming, k-means clustering and log-likelihood are the main techniques employed.
