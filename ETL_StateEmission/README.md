# EXTRACT, TRANSFORM & LOAD 

This repo contains a brief ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) case study. It follows the steps pointed out by this [SaturnCloud article](https://saturncloud.io/blog/writing-a-pandas-dataframe-to-mysql/).  
It showcases the process of loading a .csv file in python, transform it into a pandas dataframe, creating a table with the same name in MySQL and populate it with data coming from the .csv file.
Again, this is just a really basic ETL. It was one of the first I did when I started. Yet, I think it still may be useful.

In this repository it can be found (not considering this ReadMe):  

1Ô∏è‚É£. a .py file that is the ETL code.    
2Ô∏è‚É£. an in_data folder containing the dataframe loaded to mySQL
